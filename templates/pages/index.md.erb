Hello. My name is <%= data[:profile][:first_name] %> (<%= data[:profile][:raw_first_name] %>) <%= data[:profile][:last_name] %>.

I'm <span class="age"><%=
	Moments.difference(Date.new(2013, 8, 31), data[:profile][:birthday]).in_years
%></span>
years old, but I think person's experience and opinions are more important than age.

I'm from Moscow (Russia), but I can relocate and make the same things in a lot of places.

## Education

I've finished a school in a class with advanced study of physics and mathematics
with excellent grades.

Then I went to the university for "Programming Engineering" and learned some interesting things
like PHP, JavaScript, MySQL.

I've not finished it because I don't like such disciplines like philosophy, history,
quantum physics and computer chipsets from the '90s:
they were required and took around 80% of the time.

I'd like to study "Computer Science" in a good university, mostly in another country.

## English language

My level of English around Intermediate.
I do my best, and I like it more than Russian, probably because of its laconism and simplicity.

And I want to learn it more, and I think it's easier when living (or communicating)
with English speakers.

I use my devices (smartphone, PC, etc.) and all services (sites) in English.
Also, I search information almost every time in English,
and I use English for open-source discussions and all commits.

## Software development

### General

I love <%= external_link 'Ruby Language', 'https://www.ruby-lang.org/' %>.

I like <%= external_link '`snake_case`', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case' %>
and <%= external_link 'OOP', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming' %>.

But I can write code in any language.
My experience includes C, C++, Pascal, Delphi, Go, PHP, Java, JavaScript.
Especially JavaScript.

### Specialization

I'm a Software Engineer. I like writing code more than communicating with people.

Also I can design application architectures.
I was leading teams with up to 10 members.
And I can communicate with other teams (like Mobile Development) and departments (like Marketing).

### Skills levels

I'm in about top 20 Ruby developers (people, not percent) worldwide, according to <%= external_link 'CodersRank', 'https://profile.codersrank.io/user/alexwayfer' %>.

On the same page you can check other skills, like JavaScript, CSS, etc.
Of course, it's not completely objective truthful scores between all developers, but kind of.

### Projects (experience)

I've made a long path from Delphi in 2011 through PHP and JavaScript to Ruby at the current time.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="recent-projects not-for-print">
Recent commercial projects I was working on:

<% data[:projects][:commercial].first(3).each do |project| %>
*   #### [<%= project[:title] %>](projects.html#<%= project_header_id project[:title] %>)
<% end %>

[Complete list of significant projects and job tests](projects.html).
</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

<%=
	render_partial :projects_list, projects: data[:projects], section_classes: %w[only-for-print]
%>

### Open-source projects and activity

I love open-source too much,
here is my <%= external_link 'GitHub profile', 'https://github.com/AlexWayfer' %>.

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="recent-projects">
Most significant projects:

*   #### <%= external_link 'Flame', 'https://github.com/AlexWayfer/flame' %>
    My own Ruby back-end framework, based on hooks-by-inheritance
    and created for <%= external_link 'Rack', 'https://github.com/rack/rack' %> stack learning.

*   #### <%= external_link 'Gorilla Patch', 'https://github.com/AlexWayfer/gorilla_patch' %>
    My own ActiveSupport,
    but via <%= external_link 'refinements', 'https://ruby-doc.org/core/doc/syntax/refinements_rdoc.html' %>
    instead of <%= external_link 'monkey-patching', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch' %>.

*   #### <%= external_link 'Formalism', 'https://github.com/AlexWayfer/formalism' %>
    My own form/service-objects, but with inifinity nesting and plugins.

Also I've taken a maintance over projects like
<%= external_link 'R18n', 'https://github.com/r18n' %>,
<%= external_link 'Filewatcher', 'https://github.com/filewatcher' %>,
etc.
