    Music player for Windows, plays local files or audios from VK.com.
    My main project on Delphi, I've learned a lot of things
    and was trying to make a good design (via FireMonkey).
    It was hard to make a good (in my taste) visualizer.

  technologies:
    - Delphi (FireMonkey)
    - VK API

    Reincornation of Simple Player as web service (site).
    Plays local files (selected via browser) and integratation with VK (again).
    Without visualizer, sadly.
    But it worked with VK Audios faster (especially search, global too), than VK itself.
    Util VK has closed their Audio API for monetization.
    Plain JavaScript in the single file about 1500 LOC,
    I didn't think about architecture and third-party tools (libraries) at this time.

  technologies:
    - JavaScript
    - VK API

    System for detecting bots among Twitter followers.

    In these times there were many bots in Twitter and popular people cheated followers count.
    But then declaring that you have no bots among your followers
    and you're honest became fashinable. So, there was a request to make an automated tool (service)
    for detecting bots among your followers and ban them
    (it was the force unfollow in this time, as I remember).
    Then you could declare that you're "clean" and "honest" too.

    I was trying to make such system for money. Bots recognition algorythm was pretty good,
    but I have not finalize this project because I was fired up for fail
    in another parallel non-related project in the same company.

  technologies:
    - PHP
    - Twitter API

    It was a weird experience of making the layout with diagonal sections. Adaptive!
    I've made it via CSS `transform` finally, although there were many different tries
    with other approaches. Also it was my practice of making SVG icons via font characters.
    I've learned a lot of CSS with this project.

    Dashboard for Wi-Fi captive portals among cafes, hotels, etc.

    At that time I knew PHP at high level and saw its disadvantages for me.
    So, I wanted to learn any new programming language with more consistency
    and better potential for project files structure.
    Finally I was choosing between Python and Ruby,
    and I like (more consistent) OOP approach of Ruby, `snake_case` and its philosophy.

    This project was a first serious try to make it with Ruby.
    I didn't (and don't, but already more tolerate to) Ruby on Rails, its approach and "magic",
    so I've developed this project via [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/), but was a big mistake
    because of controllers architecture and it became the impulse to create
    [Flame framework](https://github.com/AlexWayfer/flame)).

    Although there was nice (in my opinion) horizontal-nested simple UI,
    and pretty good database architecture.

  technologies:
    - MikroTik firmware and configs
    - Wi-Fi Captive Portal
    - Ruby
    - Sinatra
    - MySQL
    - DataMapper (abandoned ORM)
    - JavaScript

    People transfers aggregator, between passengers and carriers.
    It's pretty popular and successful.

    The first project written via [Flame](https://github.com/AlexWayfer/flame).

    There was a lot of work with:

    *   SCSS architecture;

    *   JavaScript plugins and custom code;

    *   database architecture and optimizations;

    *   form data validations;

    *   client-side and server-side tight integration with Google Maps API;

    *   integrations with a lot of payment systems, like PayPal or Platron;

    *   translations via Crowdin and Gengo;

    *   currencies exhanges;

    *   timezones and time convertations;

    *   comfortable dashboards for different types of users, from managers to client;

    *   aggregated data exports in different formats;

    *   forecasts algorythms for prices.

    In all time of working on this project I was leading a team of up to 10 people,
    they all were different and many of them were cool.
    I've got a lot of experience in leading and talking with people,
    especially reviewing their code. ðŸ˜¬ Now I'm more calm and respectful.

    Honestly, I don't like what project became after my leave.

  technologies:
    - Ruby
    - Flame
    - PostgreSQL
    - Sequel
    - ERB
    - JavaScript
    - SCSS
    - Google Maps API
    - GeoNames API

    Cargo transportation aggregator, between shippers and carriers.
    Another project written via [Flame](https://github.com/AlexWayfer/flame).

    I've tried to make this project taking into account my architecture errors of GetTransfer.
    So, it's using a next version of Flame, 5, with a lot of improvements.
    Also we have started to use service objects instead of fat controllers and models.
    Then I service objects turned into [Formalism](https://github.com/AlexWayfer/formalism) forms.

    This project was pretty similar to GetTransfer, so I was working with similar technologies,
    sometimes with a better or cleaner approach.

  technologies:
    - Ruby
    - Flame
    - PostgreSQL
    - Formalism
    - ERB
